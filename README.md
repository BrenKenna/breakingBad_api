    b). Move onto page code

2. Add a little more to the view:

   b). Episode selector shows season & episode number

3. Base theme off of the "***Breaking Bad***" theme dark greens, white font on black.

4. Store favourites in a map { "PageX": [ 1, 4,  5], "PageY": [ 6, 7, 9] }

5. Follow & try implement the pagination from the Sports Store from chapter 7
